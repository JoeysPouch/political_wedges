""""
This module turns the 'Polarisation Parallelogram', a statistical and visual framework I developed during my MA in Quantitative Politics, into an full graph generation tool.
This particular module is designed to be part of the backend for a website, and so by defaut imports the 2021 British Social Attitudes Survey, the focus of the website. As a result, it is 
primarily tailored to creating the visualisations and associated data. Other versions of this module will more resemble a classical statistical package.
