                <h3>Zarrin Rahman — Frontend Developer</h3>
                <p>Hailing from the town of Bedford, Bedfordshire, with a Mathematics
                    degree from the University of Warwick, Warwickshire, Zarrin has turned
                    her eyes to tech for the next step in her journey. Since graduating,
                    she has completed a bootcamp run by the Bright Network Technology Academy,
                    where she learnt about full-stack software development — including the
                    knowledge necessary for building this very project! When she's not tapping
                    away at the laptop, you can find Zarrin playing guitar, getting lost in
                    the woods or farming her time away in Stardew Valley.</p>
